// This file is required by Next.js to configure the JavaScript environment
// and to provide type definitions for the project.
// It specifies the base URL and path mappings for module resolution.
// The `include` array specifies the files to be included in the project,
// while the `exclude` array specifies directories to be ignored.
// This configuration helps in resolving imports and improving the development experience.
// It is particularly useful for TypeScript projects, but can also be used with JavaScript.
// The `baseUrl` is set to the current directory, allowing for relative imports.
// The `paths` option allows for aliasing directories, making imports cleaner and more manageable.
// The `include` and `exclude` options help in controlling which files are part of the project,
